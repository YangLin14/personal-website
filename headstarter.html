              A 7-week AI development fellowship designed to enhance skills in
              machine learning, AI, and software engineering through hands-on

            <p>
              I am developing key professional competencies such as strategic
              vision and project planning, teamwork, and delivering projects
              under pressure. I am also improving my personal branding and
              networking skills, interview preparation, presentation skills, and
              the ability to pitch and sell ideas effectively. The program
              emphasizes the importance of giving and receiving constructive
              feedback, which is helping me grow both personally and
              professionally.

                  <p>
                    I started off the first week of Headstarter by learning the basics
                    of HTML and CSS to create my first personal website.
                    Pulling inspiration from various websites and online tutorials, I
                    was able to continue to improve and add new features to it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition to attending daily meetings where I listened to various
                    startup co-founders discuss their journeys, I gained valuable
                    insights into different tech fields and how to navigate various
                    career paths. I learned that success isn't just about writing
                    code; it's also about effectively marketing ourselves. The products
                    we create have little value if they aren't reaching and
                    benefiting clients.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Moreover, there were mock interviews for us to practice and get
                    used to the interview process.

                  <p>
                    On the second week of Headstarter, I started to connect more with my group members on working on the project called <a href="https://www.bideoplayer.com/" style="color: rgb(219, 179, 93)" target="blank">Bideo</a>. Bideo, a cutting-edge volumetric video player for VRChat, seamlessly streams stunning holograms with minimal bandwidth, transforming virtual spaces into mesmerizing, interactive 3D environments. Additionally, through the guidance of an experienced group member well-versed in networking and meeting facilitation, I gained valuable insights into effective performance and expectations for real-world stand-up meetings.
